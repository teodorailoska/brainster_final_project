Brainster Final Project
My colleagues and I have been actively engaged in the development of a substantial project for Kungul, an innovative company steadfastly dedicated to the creation of an application designed to adeptly scan barcodes affixed to beauty products. The overarching objective of this technological endeavor is to furnish end-users with a comprehensive elucidation of the constituent ingredients inherent to the scanned products. This elucidation extends to a discerning categorization of the inherent components as either beneficial or deleterious to the well-being of the consumer.

Concomitantly, a supplementary mandate entailed the meticulous refinement of the extant database infrastructure. This multifaceted task involved the strategic deployment of Python libraries for the purpose of web scraping, thereby rectifying the absence of requisite CAS codes. The integration of these sophisticated methodologies and technologies underscores our commitment to technological excellence and the advancement of Kungul's visionary pursuits.
